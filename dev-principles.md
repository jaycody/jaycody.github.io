## Architecture Principles

- ### Shift Happens
Things change -- the best decision made a year ago may not be the best decision now.  The system is designed so that pieces can be swapped out without affecting other systems.

- ### Principle of Hackability
The system is designed so that if it's easier for you to write a command line tool to do something, you can -- without anyone being the wiser.

- ### Principle of Simplicity
Do the simplest thing that could possibly work.
One of the hallmarks of a good design is that there's nothing that could be taken away and have it still work.  If you have to make lots of rules and exceptions to get a technology to integrate, you're doing it wrong.

- ### Don't re-invent the wheel...
...without an extremely good reason

- ### Embrace, don't Replace


- ### Give developers lots of rope
And make sure that they know they've been handed the rope.

- ### Remove Barriers to Adoption Whenever Possible

- ### D.R.Y.
The developer should never have to repeat themselves.  That is to say, once something has been said, it must not be said again.

- ### Write the same code you'd write by hand
